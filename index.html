   <p>I've been asked numerous times; what is Neo-Soul? To me, Neo-Soul is a breakout from the tradition soul offerings of the past. When on its ascension, it was an amalgamation of music for the youth. Soul, Jazz, Funk, and Hip-Hop melding together into one vibey catalogue of sounds.</p>

         <h2>Beginnings</h2>
         <p>Where did Neo-Soul begin? You can stretch the history back to old school soul and the Civil Rights movement. As all artists are just evolutions of their inspirations, many Neo-Soul artists have a ancesteral blueprint of artists such as Marvin Gaye, Anita Baker, Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Prince; just to name a few. With soul falling out of favor in popular music, airwaves taken over by hair metal, hip-hop, and funk/disco, the soul community needed a breath of fresh air.</p>

         <h2>The Mainstream</h2>
         <p>When did Neo-Soul begin its popularity? The actual beginning of Neo-Soul is a grey area due to its multi-genre nature. Historians (me) suspect the beginnings starting with the 1995 Debut Album "Brown Sugar" by D'Angelo. There were albums before it, but this album brought the sonics and grooves that came to define the genre. </p>
